# node-asfw

node-asfw lets a node.js/electron app call SetForegroundWindow.

This is probably the smallest native node addon ever.

## Trivia

It's called `node-asfw` because it was originally meant to call `AllowSetForegroundWindow`.

However, that didn't quite work out. So now it allows one to call `SetForegroundWindow`.

`asfw` makes for a fun backronyms, here are a few:

  - Always Safe For Work
  - Amazing Song, Fair Warning
  - Agony Sounds Fun, Why?
  - Apparently Someone Felt Wonderful
